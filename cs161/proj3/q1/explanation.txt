Use iconfig to get the ip address of eth1 and the use nmap to find the ftp service on port 21. When I connect to the ftp sevice, I find it's vcftpd version 2.3.4 and there is a known vulneralbility. During the login, I input some string that ends with a smiley face :) as the username and some random password. This will spawn a shell on port 6200. Then I use nc to connect to that port and get access to secret.txt
