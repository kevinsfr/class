(a) I use Wireshark and follow the instructions in the spec. Then I click on the packet on line 12 with HTTP protocol. There is line-based text data which reveals the secret.

(b) The cipher suite the server selects is TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.
The algorithms used are:
1. RSA key exchange algorithm. This is for confidentiality.
2. AES256 encryption algorithm in GCM mode. This is for confidentiality.
3. MAC that uses SHA384. This is for integrity.

(c) Use Diffie-Hellman for key exchange instead of RSA.
